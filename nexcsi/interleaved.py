Interleaved
===========

Fast and efficient methods to extract
Interleaved CSI samples in PCAP files.

~640k 80MHz samples per second.

Suitable for bcm43455c0 and bcm4339 chips.

Requires Numpy.

Usage
-----

from nexcsi import interleaved

samples = interleaved.read_pcap('path_to_pcap_file')

Bandwidth is inferred from the pcap file, but
can also be explicitly set:

samples = interleaved.read_pcap('path_to_pcap_file', bandwidth=40)
